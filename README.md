# Game Project: JUKE

## Description

This is a NFL inspired game. You are the smiling football player waiting patiently for your shot at catching the ball. While you wait, you might want avoid getting tackled by the 'not so smiling' defenders.

## Instructions

- Use the arrow keys to move the player around.
- Dodge all the defenders that are coming to tackle you.
- Wait patiently for a ball to appear.
- While continuing dodging the defenders try to catch the ball by making the player collide with it.
- If you missed the first ball continue to play, you will get another ball to try again.

## Future Iterations

- Improve Lose/Win pages.
- Making the game more challenging by increasing the number of balls needed to win.
- Implement a new level with faster defenders and faster balls.
- Add a message explaining how the game works
